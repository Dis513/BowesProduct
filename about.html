  <p>
    BowesProduct is dedicated to providing high-quality visual assets that help
    creators, designers, and businesses launch better brands and products.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    We noticed that many businesses need professional design assets — but don’t
    want to hire an expensive agency or deal with complicated licensing.
    BowesProduct makes beautiful, commercial-ready design resources accessible,
    usable, and affordable.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Offer</h2>
  <p>
    From brand identity kits to scalable SVG icons, every product is designed
    for real-world use. Our focus is clarity, quality, and simplicity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean, editable SVG assets</li>
    <li>Commercial usage rights included</li>
    <li>Simple licensing you can understand</li>
    <li>Responsive support if you need help</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who It’s For</h2>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Freelance designers creating client deliverables</li>
    <li>Startups launching new products or brands</li>

    <li>Businesses looking for polished, ready-to-use assets</li>
